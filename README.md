Features
------------

**Got database? Get speed.**
Use [MySQL](https://mysql.com) for an efficient set-up able to handle high amounts of traffic.

**Not looking for an image board script?**
TinyIB settings is able to allow new threads without requiring an image, or even disallow sending of images entirely.

 - DB schema changed!
 - Bugfixes.

Installing
------------

 1. Verify the following are installed:
    - [PHP 4.3+](https://php.net)
    - [GD Image Processing Library](https://php.net/gd)
      - This library is usually installed by default.
      - If you plan on disabling image uploads to use TinyIB as a text board only, this library is not required.
 2. CD to the directory you wish to install TinyIB.
 3. Run the command:
    - `git clone https://github.com/nolifer1337/TinyIB.git ./`
 4. Copy **settings.default.php** to **settings.php**
 5. Configure **settings.php**
    - When setting ``TINYIB_DBMODE`` to ``pdo``, note that only the MySQL databases drivers have been tested. Theoretically it will work with any applicable driver, but this is not guaranteed.  If you use an alternative driver, please report back.
    - To require moderation before displaying posts:
      - Ensure your ``TINYIB_DBMODE`` is set to ``mysql``, ``mysqli``, or ``pdo``.
      - Set ``TINYIB_REQMOD`` to ``files`` to require moderation for posts with files attached.
      - Set ``TINYIB_REQMOD`` to ``all`` to require moderation for all posts.
      - Moderate posts by visiting the management panel.
    - To allow WebM upload:
      - Ensure your web host is running Linux or FreeBSD.
      - Install [mediainfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) and [ffmpegthumbnailer](https://code.google.com/p/ffmpegthumbnailer/).  On Ubuntu, run ``sudo apt-get install mediainfo ffmpegthumbnailer``. On FreeBSD run ``pkg install mediainfo ffmpegthumbnailer``.
    - To remove the play icon from .SWF and .WebM thumbnails, delete or rename **video_overlay.png** or set ADD_VIDEO_OVERLAY_IMAGE to false.
    - To use ImageMagick instead of GD when creating thumbnails:
      - Install ImageMagick and ensure that the ``convert`` command is available.
      - Set ``TINYIB_THUMBNAIL`` to ``imagemagick``.
      - **Note:** GIF files will have animated thumbnails, which will often have large file sizes.
 6. [CHMOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) write permissions to these directories:
    - ./ (the directory containing TinyIB)
    - ./src/
    - ./thumb/
    - ./res/
    - ./inc/flatfile/ (only if you use the ``flatfile`` database mode)
 7. Navigate your browser to **imgboard.php** and the following will take place:
    - The database structure will be created.
    - Directories will be verified to be writable.
    - The board index will be written to ``TINYIB_INDEX``.

Moderating
------------

 1. If you are not logged in already, log in to the management panel by clicking **[Manage]**.
 2. On the board, tick the checkbox next to the offending post.
 3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
 4. Click **Delete** with the password field blank.
    - From this page you are able to delete the post, attached files and/or ban the author.

Updating
------------

 1. Obtain the latest release.
    - If you installed via Git, run the following command in TinyIB's directory:
      - `git pull`
    - Otherwise, [download](https://github.com/nolifer1337/TinyIB/archive/master.zip) and extract a zipped archive.
 2. Note which files were modified.
    - If **settings.default.php** was updated, migrate the changes to **settings.php**
      - Take care to not change the value of **TINYIB_TRIPSEED**, as it would result in different secure tripcodes.
    - If other files were updated, and you have made changes yourself:
      - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/nolifer1337/TinyIB) and review the changes made in the update.
      - Ensure the update does not interfere with your changes.
